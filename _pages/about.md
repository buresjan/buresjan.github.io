<div class="page-justify" markdown="1">

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Mathematical Engineering at the Department of Mathematics, FNSPE CTU in Prague. I study computational hemodynamics and optimization with emphasis on the total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC). <!-- :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} -->

## Contact & Office Hours
- Office: Room T111, Trojanova 13, Praha 2
- Office hours: Tuesdays 12:00–15:00 (or by appointment)
- Email: buresj11@fjfi.cvut.cz

## Research Focus
- CFD for cardiovascular flows in large vessels
- Shape and topology optimization of large vessel inspired geometries
- Gradient-based and derivative-free optimization, uncertainty and robustness
- MRI-validated flow phantoms

## Projects
- **Inter-Excellence LUAUS25049** — Translation of mathematical modeling and optimization techniques to cardiovascular medicine. My main focus in this project is geometry optimization of total cavopulmonary connection using the lattice Boltzmann method. I aim to integrate the available clinical data into this procees and also to experimentally validate the process.
- **GA24-11247S** — Off-diagonal thermodynamics and its connection with other factors as a route to predictable selectivity in C-H bond cleavage. My role is mainly automating the workflows for predicting bimolecular reaction barriers and performing subsequent statistical analysis.

## For Students
If your interests overlap with my work in mathematical modeling, optimization, or scientific computing, please reach out. I am happy to discuss supervision options, project ideas, or other ways we can collaborate on topics that excite you.
