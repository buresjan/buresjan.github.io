Welcome! I am Jan Bureš, a researcher focused on developing human-centered technology and collaborative scientific workflows. My current projects span exploratory data analysis, reproducible computation, and the translation of methodological advances into practical tools for interdisciplinary teams.

## Contact & Office Hours

## Research Interests
- Computational models that connect neural dynamics with behavior
- Human-computer interaction for scientific software
- Open, reproducible, and privacy-preserving data practices
- Applied machine learning for domain specialists

## Current Work
I am assembling an interdisciplinary research group that bridges computational neuroscience, cognitive science, and data-intensive methodology. Our focus is on designing accessible analytic pipelines, validating them on real-world collaborations, and sharing reusable resources with the broader community.

## Teaching & Mentoring
I regularly teach graduate-level seminars on research design, data ethics, and advanced analytics. I am also developing new laboratory courses that give students hands-on experience with collaborative programming, version control, and cloud-scale experimentation. Prospective students are encouraged to reach out about upcoming assistantships.

## Collaboration Opportunities
I welcome partnerships with laboratories, industry teams, and public-sector organizations interested in evidence-informed decision making. Please contact me to discuss joint projects, visiting appointments, or opportunities for knowledge exchange.

## Service & Outreach
Beyond campus, I contribute to professional societies, organize workshops on reproducible science, and advise community groups on responsible technology adoption. These activities help ensure that the tools we create remain responsive to societal needs.
