I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Mathematical Engineering at the Department of Mathematics, FNSPE CTU in Prague. I study computational hemodynamics and optimization with emphasis on the total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC). <!-- :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} -->

## Contact & Office Hours
- Office: Room T111, Trojanova 13, Praha 2
- Office hours: Tuesdays 12:00–15:00 (or by appointment)
- Email: buresj11@fjfi.cvut.cz

## Research Focus
- CFD for cardiovascular flows (LBM), shape and topology optimization of TCPC
- MRI-validated flow phantoms and data assimilation
- Gradient-based and derivative-free optimization, uncertainty and robustness
- GPU-accelerated scientific computing
- Off-diagonal thermodynamics and reaction selectivity (C–H bond cleavage) <!-- :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} -->

## Projects
- **Inter-Excellence LUAUS25049** — Translation of mathematical modeling and optimization techniques to cardiovascular medicine. My main focus in this project is geometry optimization of total cavopulmonary connection using the lattice Boltzmann method. I aim to integrate the available clinical data into this procees and also to experimentally validate the process.
- **GA24-11247S** — Off-diagonal thermodynamics: workflows for predicting bimolecular reaction barriers and analyzing selectivity. Role: computation, automation, and statistical analysis at Heyrovský Institute.
