<div class="page-justify" markdown="1">

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Mathematical Engineering at the Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague. My research combines computational hemodynamics and gradient-free optimization, with a particular emphasis on the total cavopulmonary connection. <!-- :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} -->

## Contact & Office Hours
- Office: Room T111, Trojanova 13, Praha 2
- Office hours: Tuesdays 12:00–15:00 (or by appointment)
- Email: buresj11@fjfi.cvut.cz

## Research Focus
- Computational fluid dynamics of cardiovascular flows in large vessels  
- Shape and topology optimization of vessel-inspired geometries  
- Gradient-based and derivative-free optimization, uncertainty, and robustness  
- MRI-validated flow phantoms  

## Projects
- **Inter-Excellence LUAUS25049** — <em>Translation of mathematical modeling and optimization techniques to cardiovascular medicine.</em> 
My work focuses on geometry optimization of the total cavopulmonary connection using the lattice Boltzmann method, with integration of clinical data and experimental validation.  
- **GA24-11247S** — <em>Off-diagonal thermodynamics and its connection with other factors as a route to predictable selectivity in C-H bond cleavage.</em>
I develop automated workflows for predicting bimolecular reaction barriers and perform the associated statistical analyses.  


## For Students
If your interests overlap with my work in mathematical modeling, optimization, or scientific computing, feel free to get in touch. I am happy to discuss supervision options, project ideas, or other ways we can collaborate on topics that excite you.
