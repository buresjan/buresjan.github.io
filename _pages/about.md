I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Mathematical Engineering at the Department of Mathematics, FNSPE CTU in Prague. I study computational hemodynamics and optimization with emphasis on the total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC). <!-- :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} -->

## Contact & Office Hours
- Office: Room T111, Trojanova 13, Praha 2
- Office hours: Tuesdays 12:00–15:00 (or by appointment)
- Email: buresj11@fjfi.cvut.cz

## Research Focus
- CFD for cardiovascular flows (LBM), shape and topology optimization of TCPC
- MRI-validated flow phantoms and data assimilation
- Gradient-based and derivative-free optimization, uncertainty and robustness
- GPU-accelerated scientific computing
- Off-diagonal thermodynamics and reaction selectivity (C–H bond cleavage) <!-- :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} -->

## Projects
- **Inter-Excellence LUAUS25049** — Geometry optimization of TCPC with LBM, clinical data integration, experimental validation. Includes a research stay at UT Southwestern & Children’s Medical Center Dallas (11 Apr – 7 Jun 2025) and a FIMH 2025 poster accepted for LNCS proceedings. <!-- :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} -->
- **GA24-11247S** — Off-diagonal thermodynamics: workflows for predicting bimolecular reaction barriers and analyzing selectivity. Role: computation, automation, and statistical analysis at Heyrovský Institute.
