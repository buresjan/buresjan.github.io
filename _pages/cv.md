Experience
======
- **Researcher**, J. Heyrovský Institute of Physical Chemistry, Czech Academy of Sciences, Feb 2025–present  
At the institute, I focus on off-diagonal thermodynamics and its application to predicting reaction barriers.  
I design and implement automated pipelines for data processing, statistical evaluation, and reproducibility, working within the group of Martin Srnec.  
- **Teaching Assistant**, CTU in Prague, Feb 2023–present  
I lead exercise sessions and helped conducting the exams for Calculus I and II, and I have also helped to develop teaching materials for the Nonlinear Optimization graduate course.  
More recently, I started leading the undergraduate course on Linear Programming.
- **Research Intern**, UT Southwestern & Children’s Medical Center Dallas, Apr–Jun 2025  
I collaborated directly with clinicians to define research tasks related to the total cavopulmonary connection. My work included preparing patient-specific datasets, and working on optimization studies. I presented our results on TCPC optimization at the FIMH 2025 conference in Dallas.  
- **Research Assistant**, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine (IKEM), Dec 2022–Dec 2023  
I participated in experimental work on MRI-validated flow in 3D-printed TCPC phantoms.  
My role included designing experiments, acquiring and processing MRI datasets, and comparing results with computational models.  
- **Intern**, Paul Scherrer Institute, Jun–Aug 2021 (remote)  
I worked on machine learning models for predicting nucleate-boiling bubble growth, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  
The outcomes of this project were presented at the ECCOMAS 2022 conference.  
- **Software Engineer (part-time, contract)**, Jan 2021–Jun 2025  
I developed software tools for the Swiss National Cooperative for the Disposal of Radioactive Waste (Nagra), focusing on data management and analytics for activation characterization.  
This role included creating interactive web applications in Plotly Dash and developing visualization tools, including RepowerScore for the Repower Initiative.
